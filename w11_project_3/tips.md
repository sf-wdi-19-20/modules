# Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Don’t get too caught up in awesome features** – simple is always better, and you can build something impressive that does one thing well.
* **Design first.** Planning with user stories & wireframes before writing code means you won't get distracted changing your mind – you'll know what to build, and you can spend your time wisely by just building it.
* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short term problems.
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies / frameworks / API’s you use**.
* **Write your code DRY** and **build your APIs RESTful**.
* **Be consistent with your code style.**
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something, because you can always go back in time to a previous version. Work on feature branches to minimize risk.
* **Keep user stories small and well-defined**, and remember – user stories say what a user needs from your app, not what development tasks you have to tackle.
* **Make code well-formatted and readable.** Are you indenting, consistently? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
* **Comment your code.** Will someone understand what is going on in each block or function? Even if it's obvious, explaining the what & why means someone else can pick it up and get it.
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.
