# Project Evaluation

Here are the areas in which we evaluate your projects. You may find them helpful as a checklist or guide. 

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified in the project specs? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program that you're in?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code and document your project?

* __Problem Solving__: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrated that you thought through alternative implementations?
