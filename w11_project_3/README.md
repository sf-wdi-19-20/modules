## Overview

**You’ve come a long way, and it's time to show it.** This will be your most advanced project to date, and it'll hopefully be the shining beacon of bragging rights for your portfolio as you make your way out into the world.

**You get to call the shots and invent your own idea**, choosing a framework & tools that are appropriate for what you want to build. Use everything you've learned so far, and **tackle something that'll push you a little outside of your comfort zone.**

Make sure it's **something you can accomplish in the limited time we have**, and make sure it's **something that'll be impressive visually**.

We expect most students will complete this project individually, but pairs may be approved on a case-by-case basis. See the planning deliverables section below for extra planning requirements for pairs.

## Big Goals

* **Discover or invent an idea**, preferably one with some group of users that would jump at the chance to really use your product.
* **Design a product _you_ want to build**, and choose appropriate technologies to build it.
* **Pitch your idea to your instructors** and incorporate their feedback.
* **Make productive use of your time**, and balance responsibilities to make a complete, impressive-looking project.
* **Focus on writing solid, real-world code** that doesn’t repeat itself and is well-documented.

## Core Technical Requirements

**Your app must:**

* **Use a database**, whether that's one we've covered in class or one you want to learn.
* **Create a complete product**, which most likely means multiple related resources and CRUD functionality for each.
* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own backend and your own front-end.
* Up your design & style game; **make a product that's impressive looking** to kick your portfolio up a notch.
* **Deploy your application online** so it's publically accessible.
* **Create a focused product**. Know which features are essential to build for your MVP and which to set aside for later.
* **Craft thoughtful user stories** that are significant enough to help you ensure a pleasing and logical user experience.
* **Handle errors gracefully**, and provide useful feedback to users when errors or validation failures do occur.

## Further Challenge Ideas

* **Incorporate external APIs** to add data and functionality to your application.
* **Use a data visualization library** to help users understand your core data.
* **Use oAuth logins** to allow users to access data from other services.
* **Build something you can really launch** and recruit a base of actual users.
* **Test** critical components of your code to ensure it works.
* **Material Design** Research the material design paradigm and apply it to ground your app's UI in the physical realm.
* **Accessibility** Research web accessibility (e.g., for blind users), and apply accessibility principles to your app.

## Planning and Deliverables

### Project plan deliverables:

**You should review the following with your instructional team BEFORE you start to code.**

* **Scope.** What are you planning to build? What do you reasonably think you can implement in the time period?
* **User stories.** What features will your app have? Set up your project and user stories in [Trello](https://trello.com).
* **Wireframes.** Sketch out what your core pages will look like and how they will work. Consider making a *paper prototype* to demonstrate and/or test key user interactions.
* **Object Models.** Draw out the model associations for your project in an entity relationship diagram (ERD).
* **Milestones.** Divide your work into about three phases, including the most essential features for your MVP, features that are important but not essential, and features that are less important.
* **Feasibility Study.** If you are using an external API or scraping a website, make sure you can get that data.  If you are using a new tool, go through its getting started tutorial. We *will* ask to see your results.

**In addition to the above requirements, students working as pairs should:**
  * Detail the responsibilities carried by each person,
  * Describe how the two people will communicate, and
  * Demonstrate that each individual will be challenged to contribute excellent work.

### Completed project deliverables:

* A **working full-stack application**, hosted somewhere on the internet.
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the beginning of the project.
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo.
* **A `README.md` file** with:
    * **Description:** A paragraph-long elevator pitch of your project
    * Explanations of the **technologies** used
    * A couple paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
    * **Installation instructions** for the app itself and any dependencies - how could someone else run your site locally?
    * Link to your **user stories** - who are your users, what do they want, and why?
    * Link to your **wireframes** – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application.
    * Link to some **entity relationship diagrams** – plan out your data relationships before coding.
    * Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** overcome.

## TIMELINE

* **Wednesday, September 2nd @ 10:30am** - Project spec released.
* **Thursday, September 3rd @ 9:17am** - Project planning deliverables deadline.
* **Thursday, September 10th @ 10am** - Completed project deliverables deadline; project presentations.

## PRESENTATIONS

Project 3 presentations will start at **10:00am** on **Thursday, September 10th**. Each presentation should be **5 minutes or less** and cover the following:

* What is your project, and what does it do? (demo)
* What was your motivation to build it?
* What did you learn?
