| Describe an explain the importance and risks of using external libraries to accelerate coding. |
| Pair program. |

#BUT FIRST!

Read this [Comparison of jQuery and Vanilla JS](http://bl.ocks.org/joyrexus/5322252) (5 min)

### Motivation (Why?)

jQuery is a very, very popular client-side library. It greatly simplifies:
  * Interacting with the DOM (selecting, changing)
  * Submitting forms
  * Receiving and sending data to APIs (AJAX)

### Analogy (What?)

External libraries or modules like jQuery are like:

* Shortcuts
* Standing on the shoulders of giants
* Letters, Syllables, Words, Phrases, Sentences, Paragraphs, Books

# Pair Programming

* Industry standard.
* Fluid switching between driver and navigator.
* Navigator gives directions.
* Driver narrates what they are doing.
* If unequal, driver should be learning, navigator instructing.
* Hint: Make and write down a plan in english of what you're going to accomplish and the steps.
