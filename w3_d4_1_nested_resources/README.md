| Students will be able to . . . |
| CRUD nested resources |

###Motivation (Why?)

In the real-world, data we want to model isn't all separate and flat; there are important relationships among the object types we'll want to work with.

Users have Friends

Classes have Students

We need to be able to CRUD *nested* data that represents these situations.
